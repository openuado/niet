### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for niet.
Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community
understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please perform a
[cursory search](https://github.com/gr0und-s3ct0r/niet/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20)
to see if the problem has already been reported.
If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to
the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possbile](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you use the niet command line, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**


Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of niet) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of niet?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can install older versions of niet from [the pypi repository](https://pypi.org/project/niet/).
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of niet are you using?** You can get the exact version by running `pip freeze | grep "niet"` in your terminal.
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **What's the version of python you're using**?
