### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for niet.
Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community
understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please perform a
[cursory search](https://github.com/openuado/niet/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20)
to see if the problem has already been reported.
If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to
the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possbile](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you use the niet command line, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**


Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of niet) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of niet?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can install older versions of niet from [the pypi repository](https://pypi.org/project/niet/).
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of niet are you using?** You can get the exact version by running `pip freeze | grep "niet"` in your terminal.
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **What's the version of python you're using**?

### Hacking on niet

If you're hitting a bug in niet or just want to experiment with adding a feature, follow these steps.

#### Prerequisites

- [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- python 2.7+

#### Cloning

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/openuado/niet
```

#### Setup your environment

From there, you can navigate into the directory where you've cloned
the niet source code

```shell
$ cd niet
```

`tox` allow you to use niet directly in a dedicated virtual environment
already configured (requirements, etc):

```shell
$ tox -e venv -- niet -h
...
venv run-test: commands[0] | niet -h
usage: niet [-h] [-f {json,yaml,eval,newline,ifs,squote,dquote}] [-i]
            [-o OUTPUT_FILE] [-s] [-v]
            object [file]
...
___________________ summary ______________
  venv: commands succeeded
  congratulations :)

$ tox -e venv -- niet -v
niet version <related version>
```

#### Make your changes

First create your working branch:
```shell
$ git checkout -b somefeature origin/master
```

> Be sure to create your working branch from `master` and be sure your master are up-to-date

Make our changes:
```shell
$ vim <file-to-edit>
$ git commit -am 'I did some changes'
```

Notice that a debug mode is available and can be easily used during your
development to dive deep in your execution and observe what happen
step by step, example:

```
tox -e venv -- niet --debug \
    oslo.deliverables\
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstack/governance/master/reference/projects.yaml
```

#### Ensure everything work fine

Every following checks are automaticaly executed on pull requests so need to
be sure that all of these checks run successfully before submit your pull request
on github.

Code formating and PEP8 validation:
```shell
$ tox -e pep8
```

Unit tests:
```shell
$ tox # by default run tests with all the python versions specified in tox.ini
```

> Note: If you have just a specific version of python installed on your system, you can test like this:
```shell
$ tox -e py311 # test with python 3.11
```

Security analyze:
```shell
bandit -r niet
```

### Pull Requests

If everything work fine you can create your pull request.

Before ensure you have [squash your commits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html).

> Be sure to submit your pull request on the upstream `master` branch!

You can create your pull request manually directly from github:
* Include examples, outputs, etc... whenever possible.
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.

### Deploy niet on PyPi
